Burn Weather Planning App

The purpose of this app is to assist with prescribed burn planning by looking at the point forecast for a particular burn area and determining if there are any burn windows in the forecast period. 

User inputs:
	Property name
	lat/long (in decimal degrees format initially. Will provide code to convert from different formats later)
	Acceptable weather parameters
		temperture: min and max
		relative humidity: min and max
		wind speed: min and max
		wind direction(s): (not sure how the API stores wind direction data, but will probably use inputs similar to Rx Burn Project)
	Preferred weather parameters
		Same as above
		
The app will fetch data from the National Weather Service API (https://api.weather.gov/points/{latitude}, {longitude})

App will filter throught the severn-day forecast to determine if there is an burn window in the forecast.
	burn window = any hours between 0800 and 2000 that are forecast to be within either the acceptable or preferred parameters
	
Results will be displayed by date with the hours color coded for an visual output.

JavaScript

I'm not sure how the data is named/formatted/structured in the JSON file that will be fetched from the API. That will determine how some of the code will work.

functions
	fetch data from NWS based on the lat/long inputs provided by the user
		
	connect/link appropriate hourly forecast data to date/hour <div> in HTML
	parse the forecast data to determine if it is in preferred range, acceptable range, or out of prescription
	color each hourly <div> based on status:
		preferred = green
		acceptable = yellow
		no burn = gray
	(It feels like these should all be separate functions, but I'm not sure how to go about it)
	
	save inputs to localStorage
	
	clear input fields and output container
	
	validate lat/long inputs and (at a later date) convert format to work with the API
	
	
psuedocode:

for the main functionality of the app
hourlyData.forEach((hour) => {
	if (hour >= 0800 && hour <= 2000) {  						// this check might be better as it's own function?
		if (temp >= preferred temp min && temp <= preferred temp max 
		&& rh >= preferred rh min && rh <= preferred rh max 
		&& wind speed >= preferred wind speed min && wind speed <= preferred wind speed max
		&& wind direction === preferred wind directions) {
				div.display.style = green;						// or set display element to = "preferred" and change color in diff func
		} else if (temp >= acceptable temp min && temp <= acceptable temp max 
		&& rh >= acceptable rh min && rh <= acceptable rh max 
		&& wind speed >= acceptable wind speed min && wind speed <= acceptable wind speed max 
		&& wind direction === acceptable wind directions) {
			div.display.style = yellow;
		}
	}
})

Or would it be better to split out everything into different functions?
	function isTempPreferred()
	function isRhPreferred()
	function isWindSpeedPreferred()
	function isWindDirectionPreferred()
	...
	...
	then another function would check to see if all parameters were preferred, acceptable, or no burn

Other notes:

Some forecasts might not line up exaclty with the output container, depending on when the forecast is fetched.
If the forecast is fetched in the afternoon, the data for that morning would be missing. Those divs should be a different color (a lighter gray).
Would that necessitate adding an additional day <div> to capture the end of the forecast period?

Depending on how the data is received, it would be nice to have the day <div>s updated with the appropriate date (and day of the week, if possible).

rh

------------

In the weather.gov API, the forecastGridData uses `/PTxH` if the same value applies to hours or days
	"validTime": "2025-11-19T11:00:00+00:00/PT4H",
	"value": "17.22222",
	
/PtxH means that the same value applies to the next "x" hours.
/PxDTyH == same value applies for the next "x" days and "y" hours
